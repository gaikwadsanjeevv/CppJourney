✅ Why Pointer is Necessary?
Heap memory has no variable name, only an address.

You can't say heapVar = 50; — there's no heapVar.

You must say *ptr = 50; where ptr stores the memory address.

Only pointers can store heap addresses

When you use malloc() or new, the memory is returned as an address — a pointer.

You control lifetime and size

Unlike stack memory (auto-deleted when function exits), heap memory stays until you free() or delete it.
